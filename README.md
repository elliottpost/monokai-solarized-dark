## No Active Development
2018-11-06
This theme has been all but abandoned. I haven't used Atom for a couple years so I no longer keep up with this theme. I will continue to accept merge and pull requests, or if you would to take ownership of this theme contact me and we can transfer it and update Atom's package information.

## Overview
A hybrid Monokai/Solarized Dark syntax theme for Atom. Inspired by Monokai Light Blue (link below) and Solarized Dark.

Forked from [Monokai for Atom](https://atom.io/themes/monokai) then modified using colors from based off
[Monokai-LightBlue](https://github.com/Kikobeats/Monokai-LightBlue.tmTheme)
